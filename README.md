The group project titled "Supervised Machine Learning Approaches to Optimize Housing Development an Sales" focuses on analyzing Airbnb listings in Seattle, Washington, with the objective of finding the optimal balance between price and customer satisfaction to maximize both occupancy rates and profits. Using the CRISP-DM methodology, the project began with business understanding, aiming to identify customer preferences and seasonal trends that influence booking behavior. Data was sourced from Kaggle's Seattle Airbnb Open Data and included listings, calendars, and reviews, all verified for quality using reports from Inside Airbnb. During data preparation, relevant data groups were selected, cleaned null or irrelevant entries, constructed readable formats, integrated multiple datasets, and formatted the data for analysis using tools like `CountVectorizer` and resampling techniques. The modeling phase employed descriptive statistics, time series plots, and sentiment analysis to derive insights, focusing on key variables such as dates, room availability, and pricing.
